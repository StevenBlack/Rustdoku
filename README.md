# Rustdoku

A simple Sudoku solver written in Rust.

Theoretically this solver should be able to solve any "solvable" puzzle.

## Run

TODO: Currently using the solver requires hard coding the puzzle. Eventually
this should support some nice frontend for easy input.

## Test

Simply run: `cargo test`
