# Rustdoku

A simple Sudoku solver written in Rust.

The algorithm for solving puzzles is very naive, but it works - at least for
simple puzzles.

## Run

TODO: Currently using the solver requires hard coding the puzzle. Eventually
this should support some nice frontend for easy input.

## Test

Simply run: `cargo test`
